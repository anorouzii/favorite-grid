A customizable grid system

The idea behind this grid is infinite customization.
You can easily create your own grid system with Favorite Grid. By default this system is similar to Bootstrap and if you have worked with Bootstrap you can work with it too. You can have an infinite number of `breakpoint` and `columns`. The system is also only `2 kB` by default which is very light.
